handle the engine's responses.

# The UCI class is the main class that you will use to interact with the engine.
# It must take the move search function as an argument, and that function is expected to be able
# to handle the "go" and "stop" commands, as well as adhere to any time limits that are set.
# The move search function must take at least the current position string,
# the time limit in milliseconds as arguments, and for max depth,
# and a Queue to recieve messages so it can know if  the stop command was sent,
# and also to send the current best move to the UCI class.
# Any return value is ignored, and the best move is sent to the UCI class via the Queue.
# Everything else is handled by the UCI class.
